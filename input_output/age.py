#Exercise 3:
#Write a program named age.py that asks the user to enter their age,
#then calculates and reports the future age 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. 
#Here's the output for someone who is 27 years old.

age = int(input("What is your age? "))
print(f"In 10 years you will be {age + 10}.")
print(f"In 20 years you will be {age + 20}.")
print(f"In 30 years you will be {age + 30}.")
print(f"In 40 years you will be {age + 40}.")
