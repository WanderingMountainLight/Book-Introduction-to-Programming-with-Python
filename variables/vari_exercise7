#What happens when you run the following code? Why?

#NAME = 'Victor'                        This Assigns "NAME" as the string 'Victor'
#print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)         This will print: Good Morning, (+ the variable sting) Victor
#print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)       This will print: Good Afternoon, Victor
#print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)         This will print: Good Evening, Victor

#NAME = 'Nina'                          This Reasigns "NAME" to Nina
#print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)         This will print: Good Morning, Nina
#print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)       This will print: Good Afternoon, Nina
#print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)         This will print: Good Evening, Nina

#The program will great Victor 3 times for morning, afternoon, and evening. Then it will greet Nina 3 times. This happens because "NAME" is still a variable and reassignable in Python.
