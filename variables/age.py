#Variable Exercise 6

#Write a program named age.py that includes someone's age and then calculates and reports the future age 
#10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. Here's the output for someone who is 22 years old.

age =  22  # Change this value to test with different ages.

print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
print("In 10 years you will be " + str(age + 10) + " years old.")
print("In 20 years you will be " + str(age + 20) + " years old.")
print("In 30 years you will be " + str(age + 30) + " years old.")
print("In 40 years you will be " + str(age + 40) + " years old.")
