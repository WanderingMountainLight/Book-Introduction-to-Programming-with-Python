#What does this program print? Why?

foo = 'bar'

def set_foo():
    foo = 'qux'

set_foo()
print(foo)

# The Program will print 'bar' becasue the variable 'foo' is
# Initally defined on line 3, and then assigned again but within the
# function 'set_foo'. Since that assignment doesn't get passed out of the
# function, the original 'foo' assignment remains unchanged.
